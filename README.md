## Usage

Install [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org).

Open a terminal to the root directory of this project.

Run the `lein repl` command.

Then enter `(max-sum (reverse (parse-file "triangle_test_100rows.txt")))` in the REPL.

Feel free to add files to the `resources/` directory or enter data directly into the REPL to test other triangles.

If Clojure is new to you, I hope you have enjoyed using it :-)
